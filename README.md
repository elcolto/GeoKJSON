GeoKJson is a Kotlin Multiplatform library. Based on [Spatial K](https://github.com/dellisd/spatial-k)
by [Derek Ellis](https://github.com/dellisd) this library is designed to work with geospatial data in Kotlin inlcuding
an implementation of GeoJson and a port of Turfjs written in pure Kotlin. It supports Kotlin Multiplatform and Java
projects while also featuring a Kotlin DSL for building GeoJson objects.
